# oasis-cpp

Oasis is a collection of std-adjacent packages that provide common utilites --
data structures, algorithms, or interfaces to an underlying system. This repository
contains code for the C++ programming language. Companion repositories for Rust
and Zig can be found, [here](https://github.com/matthew-russo/oasis-rs) and
[here](https://github.com/matthew-russo/oasis-zig) respectively.

# why
Because its fun and how I learn new things.

# status
I'm currently in the process of porting various tidbits of code I have scattered
around and theres an expectation that nothing works for the time being. Even when
stuff works, no one should use this. There is no expectation of support, stability,
or robustness.
